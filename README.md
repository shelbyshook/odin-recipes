This is my first html project within The Odin Project. It will be centered around building a basic recipe website.

This webpage links 3 separate recipe pages (which are in their own "recipe" directory) to the main homepage.

Each recipe page features an image sourced from an external website, an unordered list of ingredients and an ordered list of directions for preparing the dish.
