        <p>An easy to make dish using prepared tortellini and a creamy homemade Alfredo sauce.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="item-1">1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (20 ounce) package refridgerated cheese tortellini</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) packages sliced baby portobello mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cups half-and-half</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="item-1">Fill a large pot with water and 1 tablespoon oil; bring to a rolling boil. Stir in tortellini and cook until they float to the top and the filling is hot, about 7 minutes. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms, onion, and garlic until the vegetables are soft, about 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove vegetable mixture from the pan and add it to the bowl with the tortellini.</li>
            <li>Drain the excess liquid from the mushrooms from the saucepan. Reduce heat to medium and melt remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Stir in half-and-half, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thick and bubbly, about 10 minutes. Gradually stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>Pour the sauce over the tortellini and mushroom mixture, and toss to combine. Serve in bowls and garnish with fresh thyme.</li>
        </ol>
